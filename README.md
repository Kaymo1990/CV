## Khurram Mohammed

I am currently training to be a developer with Makers Academy. I have a varied background, having worked most recently within the financial technology sector, as an equity specialist.
This was a client facing role which also involved working very closely with the developers to ensure the products could be integrated seamlessly within a firm. Working within the
financial technology sector is where I had come to learn I had a much stronger affinity towards the technology side of my work. Prior to this I completed the Teach First leadership 
development program. This involved working in an underperforming academy as a science teacher for two years, in order to manage and raise aspirations of the students who come from 
lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Academically my background is within biological sciences with a MSc in biochemistry and BSc Hons in pharmacology, both from King's College London.

Having a varied professional background, I hope to leverage the different experiences I have gained to support the development of my colleagues, the company and myself.

## Skills

#### Client management
I worked within the financial sales and analytics department at Bloomberg as an equity specialist. This role included proactive work, through organising visits to client offices.
The visits normally consisted of what the client's workflow looks like and how we can leverage the different products available to optimise their workflow.
Clients with existing products may also report issues and improvements, therefore I would need to liaise with the developers to integrate these solutions. Through this approach I was able
to win awards for my proactive work on product campaigns, in addition to winning a quarterly award for fastest client resolutions.

#### Teaching and training
During my time on the Teach First program, I was tasked with producing results which met government benchmarks for both my GCSE and A-level students.
I was able to achieve this by having a strong mastery of the curriculum, in addition to an understanding of scientific pedagogy and learning psychology.
I designed lessons which ensured I could stiumulate engaging conversation while covering the syllabus, my lessons were inclusive of students of all abilities and needs.
I was able to leverage the skills I built as a teacher within my role at Bloomberg, quickly being recognised for my ability to train clients and being requested to assist with sales visits and
client trainings.

#### Data analysis
While supporting clients with their financial data models, I used both excel and a proporietary quantitative analysis platform within Bloomberg. I had to work with data packages and translate
the client's models into either excel using a Bloomberg data API or build it within the platform. This included clients across all asset classes, however the majority of the work
was supporting portfolio managers with data screening for equities.
